I want to build a python app using multiple agents using Semantic Kernel, and agentgroupchat methods in the agent framework SDK.

The system will have 3 existing agents that were created in Azure AI Foundry named AZURE_AI_EMBODIED, AZURE_AI_ENERGY, and AZURE_AI_SCI_ASSISTANT. The project connection string and assistant ids are already set up in the .env file.

It should be one app.

Use a Python virtual environment and install all python dependencies from file aiforsustainability/backend/requirements.txt in this workspace.
