I want to build a multi agent application with python and semantic kernel.

It should be a single page app.

The purpose of the applicaton is to raise awareness of the carbon in software and to help developers make smart decisions.

It should allow developers to upload architectural solutions (either images or PDFs) for assessment for carbon. The output will be a Software Carbon Intensity score (SCI).

Use the methods defined in this article - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-chat?pivots=programming-language-python.
